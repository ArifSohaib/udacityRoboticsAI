I added a visualization using matplotlib that shows the belief at each step

##### kalmanPy2.py
seccond programming project of course.
implements 2D Kalman filter
###### My Addition:

##### particle_filter.py
basic particle filter in 2d that moves in straight lines
implements particle filter. 

##### circular_particle_filter.py
third programming project of course
implements particle filter that can do rotation
